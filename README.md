The Food and You project is a fully responsive web application designed to replicate the core functionality and user experience of a modern food delivery platform. Developed using contemporary web technologies, the website demonstrates expertise in front-end development, responsive design principles, and user-centric feature integration.

The landing page features a clear value proposition—“Get Delicious Food Anytime”—with strong calls to action for viewing the menu or placing an order. The “Why Choose Us” section highlights critical differentiators: high-quality meal service with careful packaging, farm-fresh ingredients sourced directly from trusted suppliers, and compelling promotional offers, including up to 50% discounts for online orders.

The “Explore Menu” module categorizes dishes into Non-Veg Starters, Veg Starters, Soups, Fish & Seafood, Main Course, Noodles, Salads, and Desserts, allowing users to navigate effortlessly through available options. A “Fresh and Organic” section reinforces the platform’s commitment to health and sustainability by emphasizing chemical-free produce.

The “Delivery and Payment” component integrates multi-mode payment support and offers an additional 5% discount to encourage digital transactions. Real-time order tracking enhances transparency, while a customer appreciation feature with a redeemable gift option drives engagement and loyalty.

Finally, the “Follow Us” section provides verified contact information—including email support and a physical business address in New Delhi—ensuring authenticity and ease of communication.

This project reflects a strong command of modern UI/UX principles, semantic layout structuring, and responsive web design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases the ability to create a production-ready platform with customer-oriented functionality, aligning technical implementation with practical business requirements.
